## 📋 What is HomeGuard?

HomeGuard is a home safety device built with Arduino technology. It uses several sensors to keep an eye on your home environment. The system can detect motion, water leaks, rain, voltage changes, and light levels. When something unusual happens, HomeGuard sends real-time alerts to let you know.

This system helps you keep your home safe by giving early warnings of potential problems like intruders, flooding, or power issues.

## 💻 System Requirements

Before you start, make sure you have these items:

- A computer with Windows, macOS, or Linux.
- Internet access to download the software.
- An Arduino board compatible with the software.
- Sensors: motion sensor, water sensor, rain sensor, voltage sensor, and light sensor.
- Basic knowledge of connecting sensors to an Arduino board.
- USB cable to connect Arduino to your computer.

## 🛠 Features at a Glance

- **Motion sensing**: Detects movement inside or near your home.
- **Water detection**: Alerts you to leaks or flooding.
- **Rain monitoring**: Notifies you of rainwater presence.
- **Voltage sensing**: Monitors electrical voltage for anomalies.
- **Light detection**: Measures ambient light levels.
- **Real-time alerts**: Sends immediate warnings to prevent damage or danger.

## 🔧 Step-by-Step Setup Guide

### 1. Connect Your Arduino Board

- Plug your Arduino board into your computer using a USB cable.
- Open the Arduino software (you can download it from [arduino.cc](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software) if you don't have it).
  
### 2. Load the HomeGuard Code

- Open the Arduino software.
- Click “File” > “Open” and select the `.ino` file you downloaded.
- The code will open in a new window.

### 3. Connect Sensors to Arduino

- Refer to the wiring diagram included in the download folder.
- Connect each sensor to the correct pins on your Arduino board.
  - Motion sensor to digital input pins.
  - Water, rain, and light sensors to analog inputs.
  - Voltage sensor according to the instructions.
- Double-check connections to avoid damage.

### 4. Upload Code to the Arduino

- In the Arduino software, choose your Arduino board type under “Tools” > “Board”.
- Select the correct port under “Tools” > “Port”.
- Click the “Upload” button (right arrow icon).
- Wait until the upload finishes successfully.

## 📈 How HomeGuard Works

After setup, HomeGuard begins to check its sensors for real-time data:

- It monitors movement. If someone moves nearby, it triggers an alert.
- It measures water presence. If it detects water where it shouldn’t be, it notifies you.
- It listens for rain. This helps you protect your home during bad weather.
- It checks the voltage to spot power issues early.
- It measures ambient light to help with timing or security settings.

HomeGuard sends alerts directly to a display unit or connected device. This gives you peace of mind without constantly checking sensors manually.

## 🛡 Safety Tips

- Always power off your Arduino before making or changing sensor connections.
- Mount sensors securely to avoid false alerts.
- Keep the Arduino and sensors away from direct moisture unless the sensor is waterproof.
- Follow local electrical safety rules when setting up voltage sensors.
- Test your system regularly to make sure alerts work properly.

---

## 🏗 Support and Troubleshooting

If you experience problems:

- Check sensor connections first.
- Confirm the Arduino board is properly connected and recognized by your computer.
- Verify you uploaded the correct code file.
- Restart the Arduino and your software after changes.
- Consult the README file included in the release for detailed diagrams and troubleshooting tips.

If issues continue, you can ask for help by opening an issue on the project’s GitHub page.
