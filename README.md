HomeGuard – An Efficient Multi-Sensor Safety System

HomeGuard is a multi-sensor based safety and monitoring system designed to enhance home security and safety using embedded systems and IoT concepts. The system detects abnormal conditions and provides real-time alerts through visual indicators and an LCD display.

🚀 Project Overview

The HomeGuard system integrates multiple safety sensors with a microcontroller to monitor different environmental and security parameters in a house. When any abnormal condition is detected, the corresponding alert message is displayed on an LCD and indicated through LEDs.

This project was designed and implemented as part of a hackathon and focuses on practical, real-time safety applications.
